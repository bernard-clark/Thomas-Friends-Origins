    <h3>Ertl</h3>
    <img src="./Thomas Photos/Ertl Thomas.jpeg" alt="logo" width="300" height="200">
    <p>Ertl is an American toy company which formerly produced for the Thomas The Tank Engine & Friends franchise from 1984 to 1004. Most of which were a line of 1/64 scale diecast models and playsets of characters from the Railway Series and the Television Series. It's first model was a Thomas with a sticker sheet for a face with different facial expressions in 1984. He was later joined by Henry and James in 1986. In 1987, the characters were updated along with a release of a diecast model of Percy. He was later followed by coaches Annie and Clarabel, Toby the Tram Engine, and Bertie the Bus in 1988, and Edward and Gordon in 1989. That same year, the ranges were released in the US following the premier of the series Shining Time Station. After that, new vehicles, playsets, and destinations were produced for the diecast range on a yearly basis, which tallyed up over 100 models. Due to the popularity, other ranges were made such as miniatures, keyrings, larger Gold Rail vehicles, pull backs, and wind up toys. Ertl also produced other ranges similar to Thomas such as Tugs. In 2001, Ertl acquired Learning Curve International. The same year, Ertl Thomas ranges were discontinued to avoid conflict with the then existing Take Along Thomas system license held by Learning Curve. Since then, Ertl toys have become very collectible and some very valluable, such as the paper face engines, the metallic engines, the Silver Millennium Thomas, the 50th Anniversary Gold Thomas, and other rare characters. They can be extremely hard to find and when found are usually expensive. There have been many calls to resurrect the range, but non have been successful as of yet.</p>

    <h3>Wooden Railway</h3>
    <img src="./Thomas Photos/Wooden Railway Thomas.jpeg" alt="logo" width="300" height="200">
    <p>Wooden Railway is a Thomas & Friends toy range that consists of wooden model trains, tracks, and accessories. Back in 1992, the railway system was created by Learning Curve who held the rights until 2011. In 2012, the range was acquired by Tomy. In 2013, the Wooden Railway range was manufactured by Fisher Price through Mattel, when HiT Entertainment was bought by Mattel. The Wooden Railway range was replaced in 2017 by Wood, only for the Wooden Railway name to be revived in 2022. Wooden Railway worked together with Brio and other wooden train brands using an almost identical track system. However, its successor, Wood, had a different track connecting system, which ended compatibility with other brands, though adapters for older Wooden Railway track pieces have been produced and released. Being created by Roy Wilson of Learning Curve in 1992, the Wooden Railway merchandise for the Thomas & Friends franchise became publicly available in 1993. These original models were constructed with painted wood, along with metal used in the coupling magnets and axles, and plastic for the wheels and faces. These models were simple, with simple wooded stubs for the funnel and dome, while details such a windows, whistles, and buffer beams were painted on. By 2000, the line was overhauled and the majority of the models overwent major redesigns. The wood smokbox and funnel were replaced with a separate smokebox with a more realistic funnel. The tender engines received an additional upgrade which included a molded plastic coal pile for their tenders. These improved designs were produced until 2002, when they were replaced with a third generation kind of design, which included new faces with more detail. In 2011, the faces were redesigned again to fit in with the recent CGI series switch over. In late 2011, Tomy bought Learning Curve and acquired the rights to the Wooden Railway line. In early 2012, Tomy sold the products that were previously planned to be released by Learning Curve. In late 2012, the products that were due to be released, which happened to coincide with the Blue Mountain Mistery special were cancelled. This was due to the fact that Learning Curve had only just developed the computer generated prototypes before they were acquired by Tomy. Most of the cancelled releases with the new CGI style models were reconstructed by Tomy and sold under their name, and a few others were later released under Fisher Price. Tomy held the Wooden Railway licensing until the end of 2012, when it was later claimed by Fisher Price in 2013. In 2013, Fisher Price began producing the Wooden Railway line, which led to another redesign. This upgrade lasted for the entire merchandise line until 2017. All of the engines, rolling stock, and road vehicles were reconstructed with more paint detailing, CGI-style faces, and cureved edges to prevent edge-wear and wood-break. All models with multiple bogies had their chassis made of plastic and other slight plastic modifications were made to reduce production costs. The Wooden Railway model range became one of Thomas and Friends' most popular and longest running merchandise lines. In late 2016, some engines received smaller faces that no longer covered the entire smokebox front while others had their faces changed. In late 2017, the Wooden Railway line was retired and replaces by a brand called Wood. This would mark 25 years after the debut of Wooden Railway. The replacement was originaly announced to take place in 2018, but ended up happening sooner. In late 2021, Wood was discontinued, which allowed for Wooden Railway to revive it's name with a brand new look including elements calling back from the early days, but due to global chain issues, the release was delayed until March 2022.</p>   
    <h3>Take-n-Play</h3>
    <img src="./Thomas Photos/Take-n-Play Thomas.jpeg" alt="logo" width="300" height="200">
    <p>Take-n-Play was a Thomas & Friends diecast toy range produced by Fisher Price. It had replaced Take Along, which was produced by Learning Curve until late 2009. The Take-n-Play line was replaced by a brand called Adventures between 2016 and 2017. The Take-n-Play range went through two major changes in 2013 and 2014. The first change occurred in 2013, when several models were redesigned with noticable alterations to their faces, wheels, and overall detailing. New releases to the range would all acquire this change in their initial release, which happened to coincide withe the moving of production from China to Thailand. A new box-like packaging was also planned to house the models, which would replace the previous back-to-back vision packaging style along with promotional images that accompanied the traditional names on the boxes. Vehicle that could move soil, balast, and stone such as Jack and Alfie were given hollow buckets verses the last range that had filled magnetised buckets. The second change occurred in 2014, when severla models were redesigned again with complete reworks to their overall appearance including wheel configuration, height, length, and overall detailing. The scond redesign was the biggest change in Take-n-Play's history and all new introductions to the range all received these changes in their initial release. Most redesigned engines now used a standard four/six-wheeled chassis and engines who had more than six wheels had the extra wheels moulded to the sides of their undercarriage. Also, all tender engines now received a four wheeled tender while with once moving bogies, all gained static structures. The smaller two-way coupler magnets were replaced with a new one-way system similar to the one used by the Wooden Railway range of toys. The cabs, domes, whistles, and other detailing on top of the engines were also shrunken in size, as well as the models being made out of a cheaper metal. This redesign became the current design for the Take-n-Play range to date. In 2015, there was yet another redesign in packaging to house the models in a more compact space, which shrunk the promotional image and nametag on the boxes in the process. Although several models took a drastic redesign, certain models such as Bertie, Harold, Butch, and Captain did not receive a rework since it was not necessary to reconstruct their models. Instead, they were reproduced in the year sporting their 2013 designs, but were released in this new form of packaging. In 2016, a third packaging redesign took place, where severla models were rereleased with this brand new packaging and all new releases received a new display box. 2016 was the final year for the Take-n-Play range since it was replaced by a simlar range called Adventures between 2016 and 2017.</p>
    <h3>Bachmann</h3>
    <img src="./Thomas Photos/Bachmann Thomas.jpeg" alt="logo" width="300" height="200">
    <p>Bachmann is a model railway company that has produced Thomas & Friends models since 2002. In 2002, they started making HO scale models, in 2009, it was G scale, and in 2020, it was N scale. Most of the range's models were made from specially manufactured toolings in order to resemble the characters as they were designed in the television series. Almost all of the engines have a special eye-moving mechanism that allows the eyes to move back and forth across the rails while the engines are in motion, with the exception of Beau, one of their new American models released this year, who has an operating headlamp instead. Previously, the HO models were not available outside North America since Hornby held the HO/OO scale Thomas license overseas at the time. After Hornby had discontinued their Thomas & Friends range in 2018, Bachmann would then secure the rights to sell their HO scale merchandise in the UK and Ireland with further availability expanding in 2020.</p>
    <h3>Hornby</h3>
    <img src="./Thomas Photos/Hornby Thomas.jpeg" alt="logo" width="300" height="200">
    <p>Hornby is a British model railway company that launched it's official Thomas & Friends range in March 1985. It's range was released shortly after the debut of the television series, which consisted of OO scale model railway engines, track, accessories, and box sets based on the series. The range primarily used existing versions of Hornby engines and rolling stock to produce Thomas character replicas, as well as used Hornby's standard track and couplers. This meant that the range was compatible with other Hornby products. In 2014, the range was discontinued only to be reintroduced in late 2015. The reintroduced Thomas line had selected models, rolling stock. and sets released from December 2015 to mid 2016. The reintroduced models all kept their orignal faces. Edward, Gordon, and James acquired improved tender-driven motors and Henry was upgraded with a loco driven chassis, which allowed for being equipped with Digital Command Control (DCC) via a standard 8-pin socket. By the end of 2018, the Thomas & Friends range had retired due to changing trends and toy safety age restrictions. By 2019, Bachmann had secured the rights to sell HO/OO scale merchandise in the UK and Ireland with further availability expanding in 2020.</p>
    <h3>TrackMaster</h3>
    <img src="./Thomas Photos/TrackMaster Thomas.jpeg" alt="logo" width="300" height="200">
    <p>TrackMaster is a battery powered toy system produced by Fisher Price under Mattel in the US in 2007. The range was first launched in 2007 after Tomy lost their rights to HiT Toy Company to make the Motor Road and Rail range. Although, Tomy did sell the range in the UK up until 2010, which was when Fisher price acquired HiT Toys' license. The engines run on special plastic train tracks and the road vehicles ran on special gray road until 2010. In 2014, the range was redesigned where they are faster and run on new gray track. There are special track adapters that connect the new-style track to the old-style track and the engines can also climb up steeper inclines, but their wheels can no longer spin freely when not in motion. Following the discontinuation of Adventures in late 2018, the diecast range was updated with wheels and couplers made for TrackMaster. The line was later reworked into the SuperStaion-type line, which had multiple instances of the universal crossing track and many future products having mounting points for Minis. By mid 2020, the range was rebranded under the name Moterized, but the products themselves remained virtually identical, aside fromthe variation in the track being removed.</p>
    <h3>Minis</h3>
    <img src="./Thomas Photos/Minis Thomas.jpeg" alt="logo" width="300" height="200">

The range features several characters in a variety of different themes. They are small in size and have 4-wheeled chassis configuration and a hook and loop coupling system, and tender engines have their tenders moulded behing their cabs and boilers. The main two methods for distributing Minis were blind bags and visible bags, but blind bags were more popular. They have individual codes that identify which bag contains which Mini. The bags that released in 2015 were split into four different waves, which released gradually throughout the year, each with it's own unique set of Minis. Playsets with exclusive Minis and many multipacks were also released in parts of the world, which later became available internationally during late 2015 and early 2016.

Thomas & Friends Minis has been one of the most successful toy ranges for Mattel and their statistics show. With in the first ten months of 2015, they sold more than five million Minis in just Walmart stores alone. The Minis have also achieved astounding sales internationally as well. Due to the immense popularity and demand of the Minis, Mattel continued to expand the highly successful range in 2016, which included incorporating a variety of themes and characters into the popular toy line and creating new Minis for some previously established themes in 2015. The new themes released for 2016 were Sweets, Electrified, Sports, Creatures, Grafiti, and Core Moments, joined by Glow in the Dark and Insects, as well as an exclusive theme for the US/Canada called Tootsie in late 2016. Mattel continued the much loved DC Super Friends theme with new additions to the lineup. In late 2016, a late crossover theme called Sponebob Squarepants came, which featured many Minis dressed up as popular characters from the hit television show. Several of the Classics theme were rereleased and also acquired new characters into the lineup. Metallic, Spooky, and Racers also received brand new additions to their lineup with a few rereleases. Rolling stock was also assws to the range for the first time in 2016. Several playsets were also released, which contained exclusive Minis, along with four small speedy launchers that arrived with each exclusive Mini. The blind bag waves in 2016 contained previously released Minis titled Returnig Favorites, along with brand new introductions mixed into each series, as well as the codes being regenerated starting again from Code: 01. In 2017, brand new Minis themes were introduced including Steel, Construction, Aquatic, Night Time, Space, Monster, and Animals, along with new characters added into the Classics theme.

In 2021, a new wave of Minis was introduced where the models aimed to reproduce a design aesthetic based on the CGI series, similar to all other Thomas toy lines, despite running alongside the Plash animated reboot. A handful of new characters were introduced into the Classics line, all of which were repaints of existing characters. The 24th release was in the later half of 2021.

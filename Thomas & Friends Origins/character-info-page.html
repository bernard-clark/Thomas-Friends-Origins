    <h2> Welcome to the character info page of Thomas & Friends (T&F) Origins.</h2>
    <h3>Thomas the Tank Engine</h3>
    <img src="./Thomas Photos/CGI Thomas.jpeg" alt="logo" width="300" height="200">
    <p>Thomas is a blue LBSCR E2 tank engine who lives and works on the Island of Sodor as the North Western Railway's (NWR) number one engine, running the Ffarquhar branchline with his two coaches, Annie and Clarabel. Originally, Thomas had arrived in the Island of Sodor in 1915 by mistake due to a wartime mixup. His crew (driver and fireman) got along well with the local Sudrian people and married Sudrian women, and by 1920, neither one wanted to leave the island or their beloved engine. Through an inquiry, the Fat Controller (Sir Topham Hatt I) found out that the London Brighton & South Coast Railway (LBSCR) had written Thomas off as lost on war service. To avoid complications that would result from a change in their books, the LBSCR quietly sold Thomas to the NWR for a nominal sum. That same year, Thomas was rebuilt in Crovan's Gate Works, presumably under the design of the Fat controller. This rebuild would give Thomas larger driving wheels and a flattened rear end of the running board. It was assumed that Thomas was found with faults other LBSCR E2s had and was rebuilt into a more reliable engine. Initially, Thomas worked at Vicarstown in the RWS and Knapford in the TVS as a station pilot shunting coaches and wagons for the bigger engines to take out on the mainline. Over time, he got tired of the other engines teasing him about his size and bored of working around the station yard, so he asked the Fat Controller if he could take a few trains to other stations. After much consideration, Sir Topham Hatt decided that Thomas was not ready to run mainline trains due to him being very impatient. After rescuing James from an accident involving a field, a large hill, runaway goods wagons, and wooden brake blocks, Thomas was rewarded his own branchline to run which runs from Knapford station to Ffarquar station. He still continues to work there to this very day.</p>
    <h3>Edward the Blue Engine</h3>
    <img src="./Thomas Photos/CGI Edward.jpeg" alt="logo" width="300" height="200">
    <p>Edward is a blue FR K2 mixed traffic tender engine who lives and works on the Island of Sodor as the NWR's number two engine, running the Brendam branchline. Edward was built by Sharp Stewart & Company at Atlas Works in Glasgow, Scotland in 1896. He worked for the Furness Railway's (FR) Cumbrian Coast Line before coming to Sodor on loan with other engines, most of whom were unknown, in 1915 to assist with the North Western Railway construction project. Some of the engines assumed to also be on loan with him to the NWR at the time were his two friends Albert and Winston who were also owned by the Furness Railway. At the time, the Furness Railway found him to be a shy steamer and weren't interested in getting him back when the project was completed, so Edward was sold to the NWR for a nominal sum, who have turned him into a reliable engine with careful maintenance and extensive modifications. By 1992, Edward had been confined to the sheds and had not been used for long periods of time, which would range from several weeks to several months, much to the delight of the bigger engines, who claimed Edward was too old and weak to work, unlike them who were young, big, and strong. The constant teasing made Edward feel depressed until he was finally let out one morning in 1923. That day, he proved what he didn't have in strength, he made up for in hard work by pushing a stubborn Gordon and his heavy goods train up a steep incline and helping Henry pull the express after Gordon had burst his safty valve due to showing off. Sometime around the mid 1950s, Edward returned from the works where he got his worn parts mended and he received his own branchline which runs from Wellsworth station to Brendam Docks. He still continues to work there to this very day.</p>
    <h3>Henry the Green Engine</h3>
    <img src="./Thomas Photos/CGI Henry.jpeg" alt="logo" width="300" height="200">
    <p>Henry is a green mixed traffic engine who lives and works on the Island of Sodor as the NWR's number three engine, pulling both passenger and goods trains along the mainline. Originally, Henry was built from drawings that were stolen from Sir Nigel Gresley at Doncaster in 1919 by an anonymous engine builder who held a grudge against him, however the thief stole the wrong drawings. Instead of the new A1 Pacific locomotives Greasley was working on at the time, with Gordon being the prototype, the thief ended up with the plans that were rejected early on. These blueprints displayed an engine that was a cross between a Gresley A1 Pacific and a Ivatt C1 Atlantic, which were both built by the Great Northern Railway (GNR) at the time, with the most noticable flaw being an undersized firebox, but the mistake was realized too late when Henry was built. The thief was delighted to sell this engine onto the first desperate customer who happened to be the Fat controller, who intended to buy a Great Central Railway (GCR) Robinson Atlantic, but was swindled and accidently bought Henry instead. Henry arrived on Sodor in 1922, and since the railway was facing a motive power crisis, the Fat Controller, who was desperate at the time, had no choice but to keep Henry. When Henry came to the railway he was vain and stopped in Ballahoo Tunnel with a passenger train, foolishly believing that the rain would spoil his paint. After several failed attemps of moving him, the coaches were taken away and Henry was bricked up in the tunnel for a duration of time between several weeks and several months, until Gordon burst his safety valve when pulling the express. Since Edward was not able to pull the train on his own, Sir Topham Hatt offered to let Henry out of the tunnel to help, which Henry accepted eagerly and was later freed from being bricked up. Henry performed so well that the Fat Controller promised him a new coat of paint since Henry's original paint was spoiled more by his stay in the tunnel than by the rain. Henry asked to be painted blue like Edward, which would cause many people to confuse them with Gordon, much to Gordon's annoyance, and the matter worsened when Henry was given a spare set of Gordon's buffers after a trip to the works, which were later removed after Henry ran into the buffers at Tidmouth. To cheer him up after losing his square buffers, Sir Topham Hatt offered to have Henry repainted green, so as to end the confusion between him and Gordon. Henry, Gordon, and James went on strike due to becoming fed up with fetching their own trains and suffering from their own humiliations. The Fat Controller disapproved of the strike and locked them up in the shed for several days until they promised to work hard. Over time, Henry's system became worse and he developed steaming problems. This was due to design flaws and his stay in the tunnel. He complained about his sickness constantly, but didn't find much simpathy among the other engines, especially when it caused him to run late. A period of time came when the Island was supplied with a bad delivery of coal and Henry had the worst time of it, in spite having part replacements, there was talk of being replaced by another engine. At last, Sir Topham Hatt decided to look into the matter personally and asked for the opinion of Henry's fireman who told him about the bad coal and Henry's firebox being too small to burn it efficiently. The fireman suggessted purchasing some of the high grade Welsh coal that the Great Western Railway (GWR) uses, to which the Fat Controller agreed in order to give Henry a fair chance. When the Welsh coal arrived, Henry's performance improved dramtically, so much so that he was comparable to Gordon. Henry continued to use Welsh coal until he had an accident near Killdane while pulling the Flying Kipper and was sent to Crewe on the mainland to be rebuilt into a Black 5 (Stanier 5MT) in 1935. Due to the Fat Controller's connections with Sir William Stanier, Henry was rebuilt quickly and given a new shape and a larger firebox, which allowed him to use regular coal again. After returning to Sodor, Henry was added to the rotation to pull the express and pulled it so well that it made Gordon jealous. Gordon tried to get even by insulting the way Henry whistled, only to eat his own words when his own whistle valve jammed open and just before passing through Wellsworth later that day. Shortly after, Henry was taking a local passenger train, but as he passed under a bridge, three boys he assumed to be railfans threw stones at him and the coaches, breaking the coaches' glass and almost injuring the passengers in the process. on his return journey, he got back at those boys by sneezing ashes that stored up in his smokebox at them. When Queen Elizabeth II was due to visit Sodor, Henry assumed that the Fat Controller would choose him to pull the royal train, but the day before, while Henry was idling in the station, his steam blinded a painter and caused him to fall with his paintpot onto Henry, with the paint splashing on Henry's boiler. Sir Topham Hatt said that Henry couldn't pull the train looking like an iced cak and painting over it would take too long, so Gordon was chosen to pull the royal train instead.</p>
    <h3>Gordon the Big Engine</h3>
    <img src="./Thomas Photos/CGI Gordon.jpeg" alt="logo" width="300" height="200">
    <p>Gordon is a big blue LNER A1 Pacific tender engine who lives and works on the Island of Sodor as the NWR's number four engine, pulling the express on the mainline, and is the Flying Scotsman's only surviving brother. Gordon was built at Doncaster in 1921 as an experimental prototype for Sir Nigel Gresley's A1 Pacific design for the GNR, which became the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) after the grouping. Since the design had flaws Gordon was never put into regular traffic or given an GNR number. Between 1922 and 1923, Gordon was used experimentally until all defects have been cured of and the first batch of Pacifics had appeared, and by 1923, Gordon was no longer needed and was sold to the NWR, along with a spare boiler and firebox. During Gordon's early years, he often looked down on engines smaller than himself, but one week he needed Edward to be his banker after he got stuck on a hill with a goods train, and later that week, he needed Edward and Henry to pull the express when he burst his safety valve in front of Ballahoo Tunnel. After these events, the hill and the tunnel were renamed Gordon's Hill and Henry's Tunnel respectively. Thomas usually fetched the trains for the big engines, but left the yard to run his own branchline, which infuriated Gordon, Henry, and James when they found out they had to fetch their own trains. After the big engines had several mishaps, Gordon proposed they go on strike and only pull trains if another engine fetched them. Edward was discriminated by the bigger engines, since he was the only tender engine who liked shunting at the time, which lead to the Fat Controller leaving the big engines confined to sheds until they learned the error of their ways. Several days later, Gordon, Henry, and James saw how silly they were, so Sir Topham Hatt let them out, reminding them to behave and that he bought a new tank engine named Percy to help fetch their trains. Some time later, Gordon had almost had a run in accident with Percy when the latter carelessly stood on the mainline, which caused Percy to run away backwards and stop in a pile of earth near Suddery, which Gordon helped him out of. A few days later, Gordon was still arrogant and insulted Henry for the way he whistled, only to eat his own words when his whistle valve jammed and he ran down the mainline whistling continously until a fitter climbed up and knocked his whistle back into place. In 1939, Gordon was sent to Crewe for a rebuil. His conjugated valve gear was replaced with a two cylinder chassis and he received a smoother running plate, since the cylinders could not fit under the original one. This new rebuild effectively made Gordon a hybrid with Stanier valve gear, running plate, cylinders, and wheels, while the rest above was Gresley built. In 1952, Gordon was called upon to take a special goods train, much to his discust, so to get out of pulling the train, he tried jamming the turntable, oly to run into a dicth, leaving Edward to take the special train. After he was rescued from the ditch, Gordon was banned from pulling passenger trains for nearly a year until he proved himself a really useful engine. After a period of good behavior, Sir Topham Hatt rewarded Gordon by allowing him to pull Queen Elizabeth II's royal train when she came to visit Sodor. In 1956, he travelled to London where he was welcomed by a crowd, but unfortunately Gordon did not enjoy his visit due to his discovery that London's big station wasn't King's Cross but St. Pancras. However, we all know that London has many big stations, since London is a country with many cities.</p>
    <h3>James the Red Engine</h3>
    <img src="./Thomas Photos/CGI James.jpeg" alt="logo" width="300" height="200">
    <p>James is a red mixed traffic tender engine who lives and works on the Island of Sodor as the NWR's number five engine, pulling both passenger and goods trains along the mainline. James was designed by George Hughes and built in Horwich Works in 1913. He was designed to as an experimental variation of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway's (L&YR) class 28 locomotives, with a front pony truck added to prevent nosediving at high speeds, but unlike most of the engines at the time, James was fitted with wooden brake blocks. The experiment did not produce the results hoped for, and sometime after the grouping, James was sold to the NWR. Shortly after arriving on Sodor, James was damaged severely in a crash when his wooden brake blocks caught fire and he lost control of his goods train. After being rescued from the crash, James was sent to Crovan's Gate Works where he was repaired, repainted red, gained new metal brakes, and gained a new Fowler tender, and when he returned from the works, he became vain and troublesome. While double heading a passenger train with Edward, James accidently showered water on  the Fat Controller's new top hat, almost forgot to stop at the station, and disturbed an elderly lady with his hiccups. After being threatened by Sir Topham Hatt by a coat of blue paint, James became resentful and started bumping the coaches, only for it to backfire on him when one of the brakepipes started leaking and it needed to be mended with some newspaper and a leather bootlace. Following this incident, James was confined to the sheds and was let out again when he was sorry, and then was assigned to take a goods train to Killdane. Although he had some trouble when a few wagons broke away and almost hit Edward at the bottom of the hill, James managed to keep the train under control and deliver the train to the station on time, which allowed him to keep his red paint after Sir Topham Hatt had saw everything. Even though he had proven to be useful, James was still teased by Gordon and Henry for his past mistakes, but one day, Gordon got lost and wound up at Tidmouth, which allowed James to take the express in his place and he did so well that he and Gordon remained firm friends. When Thomas left Tidmouth to run his branchline, the big engines became irritated, since now they would have to fetch their own trains. After the big engines suffered humiliating incidents including being sprayed by an elephant, having to pull the express backwards, and spinning on the turntable like a top, the three big engines decided to go on strike, refusing to leave the shed and behaving badly when they had to work. Sir Topham Hatt eventually had the big engines locked in the sheds and Thomas and Edward pulled their trains, though they were allowed to come out when they learned their lesson. When Toby and Henrietta came, James insulted them by calling them dirty objects and bragged about how his red paint was never dirty, but he had to eat his own words when he crashed into some tar tankers at Maron, which spoiled his paint. Toby and Percy helped clean up the mess, but not before Toby teased James about never having dirty paint. Later that year, James was impatient with Edward for being late and compared him to old iron, but when two boys played with James' controls and caused him to run away without anyone in his cab, Edward and an engine inspector came to his rescue and caught him. James then gratefully apologized to Edward for his insults and Edward forgave him. After this incident, Edward was sent to the works to be repaired.</p>
    <h3>Percy the Small Engine</h3>
    <img src="./Thomas Photos/CGI Percy.jpeg" alt="logo" width="300" height="200">
    <p>Percy is a little green engine who lives and works on the Island of Sodor as the NWR's number six engine, helping Thomas on his branchline, he's Thomas' best friend, and his favorite job is pulling the mail train. Percy was built in the early 1900s by the Avonside Engine Company, and had a subsequent rebuild in the period before he was sold second hand to the NWR by an engine workshop on the mainland in the 1930s. When Gordon, Henry, and James went on strike, Thomas and Edward ran the mainline while Percy ran Thomas' branchline. Later that week, Percy was waiting at a junction near Knapford, but forgot to whistle to the signalman, and then was startled when Gordon came running at him with the express. Although Gordon managed to stop in time, Percy was so frightened that he ran away and ended up stuck in a pile of earth. After Gordon had rescued him, Percy took up the duty of station pilot at Tidmouth.</p>
    <h3>Toby the Tram Engine</h3>
    <img src="./Thomas Photos/CGI Toby.jpeg" alt="logo" width="300" height="200">
    <p>Toby is a brown LNER J70 steam tram locomotive who lives and works on the Island of Sodor as the NWR's number seven engine, helping Thomas on his branchline with Percy and his faithful coach, Henrietta. Toby was built by James Hoden at the Great Eastern Railway's (GER) Stratford Works in Stratford, London, England circa in 1914. He originally lived at a harbur in East Anglia with his brothers, and around 1945, Toby was chosen to be a special attraction at a seaside village's festival and was repainted and polished for the event. However, Toby was not allowed to join the festival due to the branchline being afraid of being shown up by him. In 1946, Toby worked on a tramway in East Anglia with is faithful coach, Henrietta, until the line closed down in the early 1950s. In 1951, Toby came to work at the quarry on Thomas' branchline after his old line closed down, since it was illegal for Thomas to travel on the Quarry Tramroad without cowcatchers and sideplates.</p>
    <h3>Duck (Montague) the Great Western Engine</h3>
    <img src="./Thomas Photos/CGI Duck.jpeg" alt="logo" width="300" height="200">
    <P>Montague, aka Duck because of his supposed waddle, is a green Great Western pannier tank engine who lives and works on the Island of Sodor as the NWR's number eight engine, running his own branchline, nicknamed the Little Western, because of the Great Western engines that run on the line, with Oliver and his two auto coaches, Alice and Mirabel. Montague was built by the North British Engine Company in Glasgow in  1929 and worked at Paddington station in London, England as the station pilot before moving to Sodor in 1955 to take over station pilot duties at Tidmouth, leaving Percy to assist with the construction of Knapford Harbour, Although Duck was a hard worker, the big engines took advantage of his work ethic and tried to boss him around, but when the Fat Controller found out, he reprimanded them. When Diesel arrived in 1957, the others took a liking to his flattery, but Duck was doubtful and left Diesel to his own devices, which led to Diesel spreading lies about Duck, which got Duck sent to Wellsworth to work with Edward as a banker. After stopping a runaway train that sent him through the wall of a barber shop, Duck regained the other engines' respect, and by this time, the other engines were aware of Diesel's lies.</p>
    <h3>Diesel the Devious Diesel</h3>
    <img src="./Thomas Photos/CGI Diesel.jpeg" alt="logo" width="300" height="200">
    <p>Diesel is a black class 08 diesel shunter designed by British Railways (BR) who originates from Darlington Works on the Mainland in 1956 and is the first known standard gauge diesel engine to ever arrive on the Island of Sodor. When Diesel visited the NWR on trial from BR in in 1957, Duck was asked to show him around, but was sceptical by Diesel's claims of being revolutionary and left him to his own devices. This led to diesel telling lies, which led him to being sent home in disgrace later that week. A few decades later, Diesel became a permenant resident of the NWR after he was sent to work at the Ironworks on the Killdane branchline.</p>
    <h3>Donald and Douglas the Scottish Twins</h3>
    <img src="./Thomas Photos/CGI Donald.jpeg" alt="logo" width="300" height="200">
    <img src="./Thomas Photos/CGI Douglas.jpeg" alt="logo" width="300" height="200">
    <p>Donald and Douglas, originally known as 57646 and 57647, are a pair of blue or black tender engines (blue in the RWS and black in the TVS) who live and work on the Island of Sodor as the NWR's number nine and ten engines respectively, pulling both passenger and goods trains both on the mainline and the branchlines. Donald and Douglas were designed by John F. McIntosh and were built by the St. Rollox Works for the Caledonian Railway (CR) in 1909, and became part of the London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) during the grouping where they were renumbered 57646 and 57647. In 1959, The Fat Controller needed a gods engine and bought Donald, but was surprised when two wngins arrived instead of one. The twins could not stand to be separated from one another, and they were smart enough to know that Douglas would be scrapped if he stayed in Scotland. Since he couldn't tell the two apart due to the fact they didn't have their numbers at the time, the Fat Controller decided to keep them both until he could figure out which engine was freeloading on his hospitality. Although the twins did outstanding work in the yard, many incidents occured including misplacing a coach full of passengers at Tidmouth, damaging a signal box at Knapford, and destroying a spiteful brakevan on Gordon's Hill. After displaying their professional work in the snow and Percy pleading their case, the Fat Controller decided to keep them. In the RWS, they were repainted into NWR blue in honor of their Caledonian heritage. In 1967, Douglas rescued Oliver, Isabel, and Toad from Barrow Srapyard when they got stuck there on their way to Sodor. When the Fat Controller found out, he had all three repaired and repainted in Great Western colors and Toad asked to be Douglas' brakevan as a show of gratitude.</p>
    <h3>Oliver the Western Engine</h3>
    <img src="./Thomas Photos/CGI Oliver.jpeg" alt="logo" width="300" height="200">
    <p>Oliver is a green Great Western tank engine who lives and works on the Island of Sodor as the NWR's number eleven engine, and helps Duck run the Little Western with his two auto coaches, Isabel and Dulcie. Oliver was built by the GWR at Swindon Works and was a push-pull fitted for branchline work in 1934. Oliver was originally numbered into the 4800 series before being renumbered into the 1400 series becoming numbered 1436 in 1946. Before the rapid closures of branchlines in the West Country, Oliver worked auto trains along the Golden Valley Line between Gloucester and Chalford with his auto coach, Isabel. He would then reach Sodor in 1967, by escaping being scrapped, and along the way there, he would take his auto coach, Isabel, and a GWR Toad brakevan named Toad. After being taken to Crovan's Gate Works, he was repaired and repainted in Great Western colors, and sent to work on the Little Western, as well as given another auto coach named Dulcie. To gain his respect among the trucks, he pulled the ring leader, S.C. Ruffey, apart.</p>
    <h3>Emily the Emerald Engine</h3>
    <img src="./Thomas Photos/CGI Emily.jpeg" alt="logo" width="300" height="200">
    <p>Emily is an emerald tender engine who lives and works on the Island of Sodor as the NWR's number twelve engine, pullig passenger and freight trains along the mainline. Emily is the GNR Stirling Single designed by Patrick Stirling and built by the Scottish Engine Company. When Emily first arrived on Sodor, she was ignored by the other engines who were shocked that she borrowed Annie and Clarabel without Thomas' knowledge. Though, the matter was resolved after she saved Oliver from having a collision with Thomas at a crossing and was rewarded with two new coaches. Later in the series, Emily was given her number twelve by getting Rocky and saving Gordon and his passengers from a collapsing bridge.</p>
    <h3>Nia the Kenya Engine</h3>
    <img src="./Thomas Photos/CGI Nia.jpeg" alt="logo" width="300" height="200">
    <p>Nia is an orange tank engine from Kenya who lives and works on the Island of Sodor as the NWR's number eighteen engine, pulling both passenger and goods trains along the mainline. Nia first met Thomas in Kenya and travelled around the world with him before finding her new home on Sodor.</p>
    <h3>Rebecca the Happy Engine</h3>
    <img src="./Thomas Photos/CGI Rebecca.jpeg" alt="logo" width="300" height="200">
    <p>Rebecca is a big yellow tender engine who lives and works on the Island of Sodor as the NWR's number twentytwo engine, pulling the express along the mainline along with Gordon. Rebecca is a Southern Railway (SR) West Country Class designed by Oliver V.S. Bulleid. Rebecca was brouught to Sodor to help Gordon with the express.</p>
    <h3>Stanley the Silver Engine</h3>
    <img src="./Thomas Photos/CGI Stanley.jpeg" alt="logo" width="300" height="200">
    <p>Stanley is a silver Stewart & Lloyds saddle tank engine who lives and works on the Island of Sodor as a shunter and a mixed traffic engine on the NWR. Although he first came to Sodor in 1953, he was actually the twentyfourth engine purchased by the NWR. Stanley was first brought to Sodor to take care of Thomas' workload during the restoration of Great Waterton for Sodor Day in 1953. Upon his arrival, Stanley became very popular and enjoyed the company of the other engines, which made Thomas jealous, and later neglected. When Stanley took charge of the Great Waterton restoration, Thomas planned to make Stanley look weak by giving him too many wagons to pull, which backfired when they broke away from Stanley on a hill and ran into the half-restored Water Works. When Thomas went missing, Stanley was the first to notice. He found Thomas in a ditch and rescued him, but burst his safety valve shortly after due to the strain. Thomas then pushed Stanley to Great Waterton. When the town was restored, Stanley brought the Mayor of Sodor to its grand reopening ceremony in Annie and Clarabel. Afterwards, Stanley was later relocated to Knapford Yards to be one of its permanent shunters.</p>
    <h3>Rosie the Small Red Engine</h3>
    <img src="./Thomas Photos/CGI Rosie.jpeg" alt="logo" width="300" height="200">
    <p>Rosie is a lively little tank engine who lives and wors on the Island of Sodor as the NWR's number thirtyfive engine, shunting trains for other engines. Originally, she wore a lavender livery and primarily worked at Knapford Yards, butnow she has been repainted in cherry red and is the head shunter at Vicarstown. Rosie is a SR USA class designed by Colonel Howard G. Hill. When she first came to Sodor, she idolised Thomas to the point where she tried to imitate him, which irritated him when he tried to deliver a special birthday post train to Alice at High Farm. He tried to avoid her at first, but after having an accident while trying to deliver the train, Rosie helped him and they have been friends since then. After being transferred to Vicarstown, Rosie was repainted red and given the number thirtyfive.</p>

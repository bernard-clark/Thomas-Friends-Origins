    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <!--Here is the start to the overview or summary of both series.-->
    <p>Thomas & Friends is one of the biggest child franchises to exist besides Barbie, Nickelodeon, and Disney. Things that make it so big are the Railway Series, the Television Series, toys, DVDs, and other merchandising, as well as the large fanbase. The many toy types that were made by this franchise are Tomy, Track Master, Wooden Railway, Take N Play, ERTL, and Diecast. The Thomas & Friends franchise had many owners including, but not limited to Wilbert Awdry Britt Alcroft, HIT Entertainment, and Mattel. Mattel, the current owner of Thomas & Friends owns three of these which are Track Master, Wooden Railway, and Take N Play. The creators for the music of the show were Mike O'Donnell and Junior Campbell. The Narrators for the first seven seasons were George Carlin, Ringo Starr, Michael Angelis, and Michael Brandon. It all began with the creator of the franchise, Reverand Wilber Awdry, started work on the Railway Series in the early 1940's. Everyone knows the history of railways. Locomotives replaced horse and cart, diesel replaced steam, and electric replaced diesel. Wilbert combined real life events with fictional characters to create the Thomas the Tank Engine franchise which later on became Thomas & Friends.</p>

    <h3>The Origin of The Railway Series</h3>
    <p>Wilbert Awdry who was a Reverand at a church had always been fond of locomotives in his childhood. He would think that when an engine blew steam that it was talking. Such as an engine struggling up a slope, "I can't do it", while the engine helping it, "I will do it". He came up with thhe idea of the first stories in 1942. His son Christopher had measles and couldn't leave his bed. To cure his bordome Wilbert and his wife Margarett told him nursury rhymes. All but one lost its entertainment value, which was "Down By The Station". To make it more entertaining Wilbert drew a picture of a few engines lined up with different expressions to match the nursery rhyme. The engine that appealed to Christopher the most was a sad-faced engine, who seemed to share a similar emotion to him. When he asked the engine's name, the first name to come to Wilbert's mind was Edward. After several questions and answers, the story of "Edward's Day Out" was formed. Soon, Christopher asked his father for more stories, which is where Wilbert came up with the stories "Edward and Gordon" and "The Sad Story of Henry", with the latter one being inspired from a nursery rhyme he was fond of. Christopher would often ask his father to retell the stories, which led Wilbert to write them down on the back of old church circulars. With the help of his wife, his mother, and their connections, Wilbert was able to get the book published by May 12, 1945. The name of this book was called "The Three Railway Engines". The two things that slowed down the publishing of the book were a missing fourth story and the lack of rough sketches to base the characters on. The fourth story that Wilbert wrote for the book was called "Edward, Gordon, and Henry".</p>

    <h3>The Continuation of The Railway Series</h2>
    <!--Here is the middle and end to the first series.-->
    <p>Back in 1942, after the stories for the book, "The Three Railway Engines", were written, Wilbert had made a model of a blue tank engine and given it to his son Christopher. This engine's name was Thomas, and this led to Christopherasking his father for stories about the engine. These stories were published in "Thomas The Tank Engine", in 1946, which would become known as Wilbert's second and most famous book. After the book was completed, he kept writing to keep up with popular demand until 1972. At that point, The Railway Series had a number of twenty-six books. Christopher later on took over for his father and added sixteen more books to the series. The last book in the series, "Thomas and His Friends", was published in 2011 to commemorate Wilbert's century. The Railway Series was later on overshadowed by the television series.</p>

    <!--Here is audio for the first seven seasons of the second series.-->
    <h3>The Origin of The Television Series</h3>
    <!--Here is the start to the second series.-->
    <p>The Railway Seres' first television adaption attempt was carried out by the BBC in 1953. Hornby Dublo models were used for the project, but the project was not successful. An engine named Henry derailed and a hand as seen coming down to rerail him. No more information is known about that project. There were several other attempts, of which was a somewhat successful attempt. The Railway Series' books, five in all, were read aloud by Ted Ray, a host on the Children's show Jackanory, until October 2, 1970. In 1979, the current television series started production. At the time, the Reverand Wilbert Awdry was interviewed on the Bluebell Railway for a feature on steam engines. Britt Allcroft, the producer, had read a few of the Railway Series' books prior to the interview and became fascinated with the characters. After aquiring funding from her local bank, she obtained the series so that she could adapt it for television.</p>
    <h3>Thomas The Tank Engine & Friends (1984-1999)</h3>
    <p>The production crew that Allcroft rounded up consisted of David Mitton, the director, Ringo Starr, the narrator, and Mike O' Donnel and Junior Campbell, the composers. Season one premiered in October 1984, and with the success of it came the second season in 1986. After the success of the first two seasons, Britt Allcroft set another goal. This goal was to bring Thomas the tank engine into the United States. Britt created a half hour programme, known as Shining Time Station, to go with the five and a half minute episodes. It began airing in 1989, starring Ringo Starr as Mr. Conductor. This started the "Thomas craze" in America. The third season returned in 1991 with a few big changes. Instead of closely following the Railway Series, many of Awdry's stories as well as the magazine stories, written by Andrew Brenner, were loosely adapted by Allcroft and Mitton. They did not give Brenner any credit. They even wrote their own episodes. Airing in 1995, the fourth season only had one original episode and featured many new characters, including the Skarloey Railway engines. By the time 1998 came around, the series was doing incredibly well and they were planning for a full-lenghth theatrical film. During the fifth season, which contained all original story lines, Britt Allcroft decided to drift completely away from the Railway Series' stories, allowing for her to showcase the series as her own before the upcoming film.</p>
    <h3>Tugs(The Thomas Sister Series)</h3>

    </audio>
    <!--Here is the audio for tugs.-->
    <p>Tugs is like a Thomas spinoff and is known as a sister series of Thomas. It was produced by David Mitton and Robert D. Cardona of Clearwater Features and ran from April 4th to July 27th 1989 airing thirteen episodes. It's short run was due to Clearwater Features filing for bankruptcy in 1990 due to the costly production of the show. However, some of the product from the show were later used in the Thams and Friends series all the way up to Season 24. One of which most fans know as Big Mickey who is a huge crane at Brendam Docks that works alongside Cranky and Carly loading and unloading cargo on and off ships and goods trains.</p>
    <h3>Thomas' First Feature Length Movie (2000-2003)</h3>
    <p>The film, Thomas and the Magic Railroad, primiered in July 2000 after many changes made to the original script. The film recieved many bad reviews which made it a failure. This forced Allcroft to step down from her position as a deputy Chairperson. Her company was sold to Gullane Entertainment, which was later on sold to HiT Entertainment. In 2001, the idea for a spin-off series that focussed on road vehicles was being tossed around at Gullane. This idea later on became Jack and the Sodor Construction Company. During the process, the sixth and seventh seasons were produced with the sixth airing in 2002 and the seventh in 2003. What is known about most Thomas movies/DVDs/VHSs/Bluerays is that some are films while others are a combination of episodes. Most DVDs had bonus items such as games, music videos, and character galleries that featured different characters.</p>

    <p>The eighth season aires in 2004 with drastic changes. The episodes became more focussed on morals and education. Every season following the eighth season would use a similar format with great success. In 2005, the ninth season began broadcasting and the first DVD special, "Calling All Engines!", was relased. The tenth season aired in 2006 and unlike the previous seasons that contained twenty-six episodes, this season contained twenty-eight episodes. In 2007, the eleventh season began broadcasting, which marked the final season to contain twenty-six episodes, until the seventeenth season. In 2008, the second DVD special, The Great Discovery, was released, which marked the final full live-action production. That same year, the show, Thomas & Friends, announced that it would be produced using computer generated imagery (CGI) at Nitrogen Studios in Canada. The twelth season used CGI for the engines' faces and the people and animals, alongside the traditional live-action format. This was the first season to contain twenty episodes and continued until the seventeenth season. In 2009, Hero of the Rails, a DVD special directed by Greg Tiernan, was the first fully CG animated production. This was the first time that all the people and engines had individual voice actors since Thomas and the Magic Railroad. Voice acting continued for all the series and specials hereafter. 2010 was the first year to have two seasons, seasons thirteen and fourteen, and had a feature length special, Misty Island Rescue, released in the fall. In early 2011, the premiere of season fifteen was released followed by the release of the DVD special, Day of the Diesels, in the fall. During that October, HiT Entertainment was won by Mattel in an auction by Apax Partners. In February 2012, HiT's owners and money were transferred. That same year, seaso sixteen premiered in the U.K. This was the last season to have anything to do with involve with Nitrogen Studios and Sharon Miller and the final season to have twenty episodes. To wrap up that year, Blue Mountain Mystery was released in September, which was the last special to involve Nitrogen Studios and Sharon Miller. A second theatrical film, titled The Adventures of Thomas, was set to release in 2011, but years later with still no news on further development, it is unknown if the project will actually move on. It has not been confirmed that the film was actually cancelled, but it is presumable that the project has been scrapped. However, rumors of production on the film have been spreading on the internet recently in 2024. Although, we do not have much information on it yet due to it being early in development.</p>

    <p>In 2013, Andrew Brenner took over as head writer and Arc Productions took over CG animations, animating season seventeen onwards, including specials, until the end of the show. Season seventeen regained the initial twenty-six episode format and implemented a new writing style that promised to focus on the original appeal of Thomas & Friends. This format was a great success and recieved a lot of fan approval. The first ten episodes of the seventeenth season aired in June 2013 in the UK followed by four more episodes between September and October. Another episode was aired in November followed by four more episodes in December. In the Autumn of 2013, King of the Railway was the seventh DVD special to be released. The last six episodes of the seventeenth season were featured on the Spills & Thrills DVD, which was aired in the UK between July and November 2014. The eighteenth season was aired in the Autumn of 2014 followed by the release of Tale of the Brave, a feature-length special. The last six episodes of the eighteenth season were featured on the Dinos and Discoveries DVD premiered in July 2015 in the UK. In 2015, Thomas & Friends celebrated their 70th Anniversary with a 44-minute special, The Adventure Begins, released in the Spring, being the first feature to include original stories by the Reverand Wilbert Awdry since 1995. Later on the 14th of July 2015, a special 28-minute documentary, titled 70 Years of Friendship, was exclusively released on the Thomas & Friends YouTube channel. In the fall that same year, the DVD special, Sodor's Legend of the Lost Treasure, was released. The first four episodes of the nineteenth season premiered in the UK between the 21st and 24th of September 2015. The nineteenth season aired in the US on October 13, 2015. In January 2016, three more episodes of the nineteenth season aired in the UK, followed by five more in March. During that same month, six more episodes of the nineteenth season released on the annual mini-tentpole, episodic release, "Start Your Engines!". These episodes would later air in July 2016 in the UK. On April 9, 2016, a special 4-D theme-park exclusive production was released, titled Thomas & Friends in 4D: Bubbling Boilers, in Boston. In August 2016, Arc Productions filed for bankruptcy then closed down, but was later aquired by Jam Filled Entertainment on August 22, 2016. Some of the former Arc staff regained their jobs and resumed working on animation for Thomas & Friends under the new management and organization name. The next DVD special, The Great Race, released in September 2016. The twentieth season began broadcasting on September 5, 2015 in the UK with the first five episodes in the season and aired in the US on October 21, 2016. Later on, HiT Entertainment and SiF releasd a poll where fans voted for what they wanted to see rendered in GC for the season. This marked the first season since the fourth season to adapt Railway Series stories, with the book Small Railway Engines, being adapted into the final three episodes of the season. In 2017, a special, titled Journey Beyond Sodor, aired in the fall, followed by the premiere of the twenty-first season shortly after, which was the first season entirely animated by Jam Filled Entertainment. The twenty-first season was cut short to allow time for development for the twenty-second season. This season was seen to have more slapstick umour and fast pacing in an effort to ease audiences into the soft reboot that occurred the next season.</p>

    <p>In 2017, it was revealed tht the series would be drastically revamped. The series' name changed to "Thomas & Friends: Big World! Big Adventures!" match the special with the same name, which released theatrically in the UK in the summer of 2018. The movies as well as the first half of the twenty-second season revolved around Thomas travelling the world and learning about different cultures, while the second hlf would take place on Sodor. The theme song was changed to "Big World! Big Adventures!", the visuals became faster-paced with greater emphasis on comedy and action, animals became a more prominent feature of the stories, and fantasy stories became more prevalent, with at least one fantasy sequence in every episode. The show would replace the narrator with Thomas speaking to the audience. Edward, Henry, and Toby would be removed from the Steam Team in favor of Nia and Rebecca in an effort to bring the gender ratio among the main cast to a 50/50 split. The episodes' runtime would be split into 7-minute stories (two minutes shorter than the time used for seasons 113 - 21) and 4-minute segments featuring songs, puzzles, and other activities. This would make Thomas & Friends similar to other preschool shows, which in turn would keep it relevant. On november 9, 2018, the main cast made their special online video appearance wearing Pudsey Bear ears for the BBC's Children in Need. Upgrades were done to five out of the seven Steam Team characters ahead of the airing of the twenty-third season in the fall of 2019. These characters were Thomas, Percy, Emily, James, and Gordon. During the summer of that year, a premiere of Digs & Discoveries was showcased at Drayton Manor's 4D cinema for a week before it was released on DVD and shown on television. By the beginning of 2020, Thomas & Friends had moved fromcable television on Nickelodeon in the USA to streaming exclusively on Netflix, for the 75th Anniversary, starting with Steam Team to the Rescue. During the celebrations, Thomas & Friends The Royal Engine was shown along with a live-action introduction of Prince Harry, which was followed by the twenty-fourth season and Marvellous Machinery. This marked the final productions for the original television series with a grand total of 584 episodes, 13 feature lenght specials, and one theatrical film. By October 2020, Mattel announced that they were collaborating with Corus Entertainment's Nelvana Studio to produce a full on 2D reboot. It was titled Thomas and Friends: All Engines Go, which had been broadcast during the autumn of 2021, and took a comepletely different direction from the original show, while a live action and animated hybrid theatrical film is set to be directed by Marc Foster.</p>

    <p>All Engines Go is a Thomas & Friends reboot. It aired in the US on Cartoon Network on September 13, 2021, in the UK on Milkshake! on November 8, 2021, and on Netflix in the US on October 29, 2021. The spinoof had planned for over two seasons with 104 11-minute episodes and two 60-minute specials. The new format includes a new look and story structure, original songs, and Thomas as the main character of every episode.
